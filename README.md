I solved 3x3 puzzle with A Greedy and A Star algoritm that you can select Manhatan or Hamming heuristic.

- You can change the init state and the finish state at line 57 and 63, the variables are initMatrix and endMatrix.

- After program starts you will select the A type algoritm and the heuristic
